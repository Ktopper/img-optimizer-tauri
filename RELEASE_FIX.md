# ðŸ”§ Release Error - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong
The GitHub Actions workflow had an invalid tag format that caused the release error.

## What I Fixed
âœ… **Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml`** to use proper tag references:
- Changed `tagName: v__VERSION__` to `tagName: ${{ github.ref_name }}`
- Fixed release name format
- Improved release description

## How to Try Again

1. **Commit the fixes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions release workflow"
git push origin main
```

2. **Create a new release tag:**
```bash
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

3. **Check the GitHub Actions:**
- Go to: https://github.com/Ktopper/img-optimizer-tauri/actions
- You should see the workflow running
- It will build for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Creates a proper release with signed binaries

## What to Expect
- âœ… Workflow runs without errors
- âœ… Release created at: https://github.com/Ktopper/img-optimizer-tauri/releases
- âœ… Signed installers for all platforms
- âœ… Auto-update system working

The tag format issue has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
