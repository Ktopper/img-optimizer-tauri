I'm tinkering with a Tauri app for optimizing images â€“ it's my playground for merging the power of Rust with the elegance of React.  Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for web images, fine-tuned for peak performance.


# Image Optimizer

A powerful desktop application built with Tauri and React for batch processing and optimizing images with various conversion options.

## Features

- Convert images to WebP format
- Resize images to specific dimensions:
  - 700x700px square
  - 300x300px square
  - 1600px width
  - Custom width with aspect ratio preservation
- Convert images to different formats:
  - ICO (favicon)
  - JPG
  - PNG (100x100)
- Apply image effects:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Image overlay with multiple positioning options
- Aspect ratio conversion with presets:
  - 16:9
  - 3:2
  - 2:1
  - 1:2
  - 3:4
  - 4:3
  - 5:3
- Batch processing for folders

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- Rust (Latest stable version)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd img-optimizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Rust dependencies
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo build
   cd ..
   ```

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be available in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
